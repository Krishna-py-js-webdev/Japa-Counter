Japa Counter 🧘‍♂️📿
A simple, reliable Japa counting web app
🚀 Why I Built This
While traveling, I realized I didn’t have my mala, and the existing apps were too glitchy. So, I built my own Japa Counter with smooth performance and a distraction-free experience.

✔ Local Storage – Saves counts even after reloads
